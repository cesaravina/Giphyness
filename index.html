<!-- 
	Heroku is served over https (you can think of that as standing for `http secure`),
	so in order to load external scripts on Heroku, you need to ensure that the protocol is set 
	to https.

	If you don't set the protocol at all, then the script will be loaded with whichever
	protocol the html is being served with.

	In the case of simply opening the file in your browser, the protocol will be set to `file`
	which will fail for this script since you don't have the jquery source code in the repo
	(you don't want to have it here, either).
-->
<!-- In the case of the jQuery library, you can fix this issue by adding `https:` to the script below -->
